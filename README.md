# 3D-Design-Using-SOLIDWORKS
 General Workshop - Fall 2020

 ## Homework 1
 In this assignment, I have created a 3D model of one of the car's parts in SOLIDWORKS. You can see its picture in "HW1.bmp". To view "SolidWorksHW1.SLDPRT" you can use https://sharecad.org/

 ## Homework 2
 This assignment has two parts. In the first step, I designed a beautiful flowerpot which was in our house, and unfortunately, I broke it by accident :D
In the second step, the G-Code file is generated to make it possible to print the design with a 3D printer. I am guilty of breaking the flowerpot, but I am blessed that I have done something that made it immortal and I can create it again with any 3D printer available in the world: )

 For viewing the "SolidWorksHW2.SLDPRT" you can use https://sharecad.org/

"HW2.bmp" and what you would see in the SLDPRT online viewer are not accurate. To view it accurately I encourage you to view it in the SOLIDWORKS official application.
